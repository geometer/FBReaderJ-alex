How to Build for Android
------------------------

Prerequisites:

1. Android SDK >= 1.6

2. Android NDK >= r4b

3. python

To build:

1. Create 'local.properties' file containing sdk.dir && ndk.dir definitions:
	sdk.dir=<path to the Android SDK folder>
	ndk.dir=<path to the Android NDK folder>
E.g., on my computer 'local.properties' consists of 2 lines:
  sdk.dir=/Users/geometer/android-sdk-mac_86
  ndk.dir=/Users/geometer/android-ndk-r4b

2. If you use Linux or MacOS, just run 'ant package' and go to step 3. For debugging 
purposes, you might want to run 'ant dbg' for building the package in debug mode, signing 
with your debug key (in this case, you can skip step 3).

If you are Windows user
  2a. Run ndk-build (a program from Android NDK directory) in your project catalog;
      This program only runs from Cygwin >= 1.7, please read NDK docs for details.
  2b. Run ./createRawResources.py script.
  2c. Run 'ant release'.

3. Sign your package manually.
