How to Build for Android
------------------------

Requirements: Android SDK 1.6, Android NDK 1.5

1. Compile native code.
   This step could be skipped, prebuilded native libraries are currently included into the source package.

2. Create 'local.properties' file containing sdk-location definition:
	sdk-location=<path to the Android SDK folder>

3. Run './createRawResources.py'.

4. Run 'ant release'.
